To create a multi-channel notification delivery system, we can follow a modular approach where each channel (push, SMS, email, etc.) is handled by a separate module. This approach allows for easy scalability and maintenance of the system.


Here is a high-level architecture diagram of the system:

The Notification Service is responsible for receiving notification requests from the application and forwarding them to the appropriate channel module(s). Each channel module is responsible for sending notifications through its respective channel.


The registerModule method allows us to add new channel modules to the Notification Service. The sendNotification method loops through all registered modules and calls their send method with the notification payload.


The send method of each channel module should accept a notification payload and send the notification through its respective channel.
